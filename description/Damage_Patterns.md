# Damage Patterns
The following **damage patterns** are used in order to better convey the fields
affected by an attack with a specific weapon. These patterns are *just* for illustration and will never actually
be printed in-game. The following symbols will be used in the damage pattern illustrations:

| Symbol  | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<C>`   | The character performing an attack with the respective weapon.                                                                                                      |
| `<!>`   | The field the attack was performed on (represented by the `<POSITION>` parameter of the `attack` command for players). This field is always affected by the attack. |
| `<+>`   | Additional by the attack affected fields.                                                                                                                           |

> **Note**: The same amount of damage is dealt on every field marked with `<!>` and `<+>`.

### Melee

Each damage pattern should be **rotated** according to the character-adjacent field which was the target of the attack.

#### Hit

### Ranged

Ranged attacks can target any position in the current room. The position of the attacker does not change the damage pattern,
therefore it is not shown in the following patterns. Since the ranged damage patterns are symmetrical, they do not need to be rotated.
