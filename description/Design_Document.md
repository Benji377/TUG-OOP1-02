# Design Document

The purpose of writing a design document is to first understand the assignment description and the game. You should
decide on the basic structure and design of your program. You will then discuss your design with other teams in a discussion
round. If you later notice that you need to change something in the structure, that is of course possible.

The aim of the discussion round is to help you decide on a well-structured design early on in the implementation process.
Taking part in a discussion round is mandatory. It is important that every team member participates during the discussion.

> **Note:** Handing in the design document is not worth any points, but it is **mandatory** to submit a document that shows some effort
to receive a positive grade on the design practicals (KU).

## Content of the Design Document

The design document should include information about the following:
- the classes you will use for your implementation
- a short description (1-2 sentences or keywords) of the purpose of each class
- a list of the most important methods and member variables of each class - it is not necessary to provide the full function
  headers and data types
- relations between the classes (e.g., inheritance)

You should also visualize your design using a **UML diagram**. Simple drawings by hand or digital are fine. It is important 
that the graphic helps to understand the structure of your program. The visualization does not need to be extremely detailed.

## Questions to ask yourself

Below are a few questions to think about and discuss with your group when deciding on the design. This list is non-exhaustive,
you also need to come up with your own ideas.

- What is the overall class structure? How do the objects interact with each other?
- How are characters, items and rooms represented?
- How is a player or enemy phase structured?
- How are the story messages stored initially?
- How is the dungeon stored internally?
- How are commands read in and handled?
- How are damage patterns handled and stored?
