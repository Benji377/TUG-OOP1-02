/*
 * Quick Notes:
 * - The class of each prop is saved as a string like "xdy" where x is the amount of dice and y the dice size.
 * - The weapons can have different properties depending on the character. For character specific properties,
 * use the Abbreviation with an `-X` at the end. The characters that apply are also stored.
 * So basically we store those weapons twice, one for the all characters (default) and extension (-X) for the specific character.
