# Assignment 3 - Dungeons & Classes AI

## How to proceed after A2

Participation in A3 is not mandatory to pass the course, but it will give you additional points to improve your grade.

This [Overview Picture](https://www.notion.so/coding-tugraz/OOP1-4b4ebbd89b9744b3ad1a714ede74690c?pvs=4#37da80680b2d4797a0db88dbd54bd81f) shows your possibilities after A2. 

To participate in A3, your submission for A2 needs to pass at least 66 % of all test cases for A2 (= 20 passed test cases)
by the A2 deadline.

If you do not fulfill this requirement, you can spend the time until the A3 deadline (12.06.2024, 23:59 (GMT+1))
improving your A2 and **are not allowed to do A3**. If your submission for A2 fulfills this 
requirement, you can still **choose** to improve your A2 instead of doing A3. **In both those cases, push your improved 
solution to the `submission` branch.** The points achieved by this will replace your points from the 
original A2 deadline. You will not get any points for A3. Anything written below this point is not relevant for you.

If you fulfill the necessary requirement and decide to implement A3, your points from A2 will stay as they were at the A2 deadline,
even if you improve your program to pass additional A2 test cases in the course of implementing A3. Any points you receive for A3 will
be added to that. 

If you participate in A3, you will write an artificial intelligence (AI) which can choose actions in the `Player Phase` 
in OOP1 _Dungeons & Classes_.

## Specifications

Some general specifications must be followed for every assignment in this course. A list of these specifications can be
found here: [Assessment of Assignments - Deductions](https://www.notion.so/coding-tugraz/Assessment-of-Assignments-How-do-you-get-your-points-work-in-progress-00d2624846f4491391b389e6a48fa180?pvs=4#0af0c923deff4c4bb8740f5698aca451)

Please follow these specifications to avoid point deductions.

Additional specifications must be followed for this assignment (A3) as well.

The following violations result in **0 points for this assignment (-100 %)**:
- Only a trivial solution (e.g., only random movements of the characters) was implemented
- `whoami` command was not implemented
- AI uses information that would not be available to a human player (e.g., contents of an unopened chest, enemies in the next room)
- AI does not work offline
- External libraries are used (e.g., for generating a database, machine learning libraries etc.)

The following violations result in a **deduction of -25 % each**:
- AI chooses an input that results in an error
- AI uses `quit` or Display Commands (`help`,  `map`, `story`, `positions`, `player` or `inventory`)
- Any of the test cases that pass in the A2 submission do not pass anymore

## Grading

Assignment 3 is worth **15 points**.

Your AI will play games on multiple dungeon configurations and you will receive points for how well it does.
There will be multiple execution runs on each dungeon to counteract the randomness of the dice.

The points you receive in this assignment will be determined by

- your AI's ability to play the game
- your participation in A3 and
- your presentation and explanation of your AI after the A3 deadline (A3 assignment interview)

The coding style will not be evaluated for this assignment.

<details>
<summary><h3>Details about the Grading</h3></summary>

The points for A3 are calculated as follows:

```
final points = AI points - deductions
```

Whenever the game end is mentioned in the section below, this means **any** game end, no matter if all players die, the 
players flee, or the Lich is defeated.

If your AI does not reach a game end in at most double the number of actions of our reference AI that was implemented by
the tutors, we will assume that your AI is stuck. In this case, the game will be aborted and will be graded as if all 
players had died at that point.

The AI points are calculated as follows:

```
AI points = min{(sum-of-results-of-all-dungeons-used-for-grading / amount-of-dungeons-used-for-grading), 1} * 15
```

The results for each dungeon take the following into account:
- if your AI wins the dungeon (Lich is defeated)
- the number of players alive at game end
- the number of completed rooms at game end

From this an indicator is calculated for how well your AI does on each dungeon.

```
indicator = win-bonus (2 if won, 0 if not won) + players-alive-at-game-end (0 to 3) + completed-rooms-at-game-end (0 to 9)
```

The indicator is converted into a dungeon result in the following way:

| indicator for the dungeon | result for the dungeon |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 0                         | 0.0                    |
| 1 to 4                    | 0.4                    |
| 5 to 7                    | 0.6                    |
| 8 to 10                   | 0.8                    |
| 11, 12                    | 1.0                    |
| 13, 14                    | 1.2                    |

The results for all dungeons are then averaged as mentioned above. This means that you can compensate for a bad result on 
one dungeon by doing especially well on another dungeon. The points you can receive for A3 are capped at 15, even if your AI
gets a perfect result on all dungeons used for grading.

## Submission
- Push to a **branch named `a3` in your team's gitlab repository for A2**
    - The last commit on this branch before the deadline will be graded.
- Deliverables: all .cpp and .hpp files needed to run your program
- **Deadline: 12.06.2024, 23:59 (GMT+1)**
- **Assignment 3 is group work!** Team members who do not contribute to the implementation of A3 will not get any points for it.
    Try to keep the distribution of labor even for A3 as well.

## Tasks in A3
In this assignment you will extend **your already existing implementation of A2** with an artificial intelligence (AI). 
Your AI should calculate the best action to take next in the `Player Phase`.

Your AI should assume that all three playable characters are chosen every game. Games with one or two players will not be used
for grading.

In this assignment, you will add two new commands to your implementation. The new commands
should be executable whenever your program waits for user input in the `Player Phase`. The handling of 
**invalid number of parameters** errors should be extended to also include the new commands.

<details>
<summary><h3>Command: whoami</h3></summary>

The first new command is `whoami`. This command does **not** count as an action.

> **Attention:** This command is mandatory! You won't get any points if this feature is not implemented.

The command prints the name of your team in the following format:

```
Team: <NAME>\n
```

Here, `<NAME>` is a placeholder and should be replaced by your team's name. This name may be chosen arbitrarily (max. 20
ASCII or UTF-8 encoded characters). Creative team names are very welcome, however, please do not use any names that could
hurt people. The team name printed by `whoami` will appear later in a high score list, which is managed by the course team.
Your program should always output the same team name with the `whoami` command.

#### Example

```
> whoami\n
Team: Crypt-Kickers-27\n
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Command: play</h3></summary>

When the command `play` is entered, the AI should step in and choose a single Action Command. This Action Command should then 
be printed as shown below. Afterwards, it should be executed as if it had been a normal user input. This Action Command
of course also counts as an action, as described in A2.

The main goal of the AI is to finish the game (see [Grading](#grading) for a detailed explanation on what results are preferable).

> **Attention**: The execution of a single `play` command must not take longer than 1 second, otherwise the game will be aborted.

The `play` command's output has the following form:

```
AI: <EXECUTED_COMMAND> <PARAMETERS>\n
```

where the placeholders `<EXECUTED_COMMAND>` and `<PARAMETERS>` specify a command and its parameters, respectively. 

All commands and parameters should be printed in lower case letters. There should always be a single space between the 
command and the first parameter, as well as between parameters. There should not be a space after the last parameter.

#### Examples

```
AI: move w 2,1\n
```

```
AI: loot r 2,3\n
```

```
AI: use b nhep\n
```

```
AI: attack w 1,1\n
```

## Example Game

The following listing shows example outputs of a possible AI. Note that your AI may produce different actions. Also note 
that the output in the following listing is truncated and only the first room is shown.
